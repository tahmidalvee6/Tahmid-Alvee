                    <h3>Squid Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by the intense and suspenseful "Red Light, Green Light" game from Squid Game, I developed an interactive challenge where every move matters. Players must carefully navigate forward, stopping precisely when the light turns redâ€”any movement during this phase results in instant elimination. The game tests reaction time, strategy, and precision, creating an immersive and thrilling experience. With smooth mechanics and engaging gameplay, it keeps players on edge as they race against time while avoiding detection. Designed for desktop and laptop play, this project combines elements of suspense and challenge to deliver an exciting experience for gamers of all levels. Whether you're a fan of Squid Game or simply enjoy high-stakes, challenge-based games, this will push your limits and keep you coming back for more. Play now and see if you have what it takes to survive the game!

                    <h3>Catch the Fish, Cat!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Catch the Fish, Cat! is my very first game developed in Scratch, where players help a playful cat catch as many fish as possible to earn points within a set time limit. The game offers two versions to cater to different user preferences: the Keyboard Version, designed for laptop and PC users, allows for precise navigation using keyboard controls to catch fish and rack up the highest score, while the Touch/Mobile-Friendly Version ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience on mobile devices, with intuitive touch controls and mouse support for PC users. This project has been an incredible learning journey, teaching me valuable lessons in game mechanics, user interaction, and optimizing gameplay for multiple devices. I focused on making the game accessible and fun, ensuring a seamless experience whether you're playing on a computer or mobile. It was also a great opportunity to practice my problem-solving and game design skills, and I'm excited to continue improving my game development abilities. This game not only challenged my creative thinking but also helped me understand the importance of user feedback, which Iâ€™m eager to incorporate into future projects.
